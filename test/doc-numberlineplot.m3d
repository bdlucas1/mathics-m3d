TODO: these tests aren't incorrect exactly, but the x axis sizing
is not right. See render.py:348 for a fix, but do it along with
with a more general improvement of axes padding.                                               

``` m3d test:doc-039
NumberLinePlot[Prime[Range[10]]]
```

``` m3d test:doc-040
NumberLinePlot[Table[x^2, {x, 10}]]
```

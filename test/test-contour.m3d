Problems:
* colors arent great - try something based on hsv?
* line colors should be different - problem in front-end?
* graph isn't square - looks like maybe extra space in y but not x?
```
is = {1000,1000};
Grid[{
    {ContourPlot[x^2 - y^2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, ImageSize->is],
    ContourPlot[{x^2+y^2 == 1, x^2-y^2==0.5} , {x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}, ImageSize->is]},
    {ContourPlot[{x^2+y^2 == 1} , {x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]}
}]
```

Problems:
* not square
```
ContourPlot[{x^2+y^2 == 1, x^2-y^2==0.5} , {x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]
```

Problem:
* range specification isn't being honored in chart - should be space around circle.
Front-end intepretation of Automatic??
```
ContourPlot[{x^2+y^2 == 1} , {x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]
```

```
DensityPlot[x^2+y^2, {x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]
```

Problems:
* colors arent great - try something based on hsv?
* graph isn't square - looks like maybe extra space in y but not x?
* is is getting scaled when in Grid/Row even if explicitly specified

```
ContourPlot[x^2 - y^2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]
```

```
ContourPlot[x^2 - y^2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, ImageSize->{100,100}]
```

``` m3d
is = {1000,1000};
Grid[{
    {ContourPlot[x^2 - y^2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}],
    ContourPlot[{x^2+y^2 == 1, x^2-y^2==0.5} , {x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}], ImageSize->{100,100}},
    {ContourPlot[{x^2+y^2 == 1} , {x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]}
}]
```
``` m3d autorun:off
ContourPlot[{x^2+y^2 == 1, x^2-y^2==0.5} , {x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]
```

Let's see how the color function looks for density plots
``` m3d autorun:off
DensityPlot[Cos[x] Sin[y], {x,-15,15},{y,-10,10}, PlotRange->{100,200}]
```
